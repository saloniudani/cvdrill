# cvdrill

Apache Drill is a distributed MPP query layer that supports SQL and alternative query languages against NoSQL and Hadoop data storage systems.  It was inspired in part by [Google's Dremel](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html).  This version contains a plugin contribution for Apache SOLR.
